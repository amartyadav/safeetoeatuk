# SafeToEat

Basic android app that fetches data on restaurant health and safety from the UK Food Hygiene Rating data API https://www.food.gov.uk/uk-food-hygiene-rating-data-api.
It displays the data in a user friendly way by letting the user search for restaurant information by name, location or postcode. 

This was developed as a toy project to learn the basics of android development.
